# E-commerce App
For this project I've worked in React.js, with things like Stripe, to make real card transactions, and build a e-commerce application fully functional using Commerce.js.\
Is a simple tech web page that allows the user to add items to the cart, viewing the price per unit and the sub-total. With a nice checkout interface in two steps, made with Material-ui styles.

## Setup
To install the dependencies run ```npm install or yarn install``` on the folder.\
To start the app run ```npm start or yarn start``` on the folder.
